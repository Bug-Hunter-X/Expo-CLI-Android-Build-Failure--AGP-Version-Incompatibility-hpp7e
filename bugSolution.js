The solution involves updating the Gradle wrapper properties to match the latest Android Gradle Plugin version that is compatible with the Expo CLI and your project dependencies.  This usually entails modifying the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file located in the `android/gradle/wrapper` directory of your Expo project.

Here's an example showing how to update the Gradle version to 7.5:

```gradle
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.5-all.zip
```

After modifying the gradle version, run the following command in the terminal in your project directory:

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

Then try building the app again using `expo build:android`. If the issue persists you may need to consult the Expo documentation for further troubleshooting steps.
